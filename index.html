        <p>Someone falls to pieces
Sleeping all alone someone kills the pain spinning in the silence, she finally drift away someone gets excited in a chapel yard.Catches a bouquet another lays a dozen. White roses on a grave and be yourself is all that you can do. To be yourself is all that you can do, someone finds salvation in everyone another only pain. Someone tries to hide themself. Down inside himself he prays. Someone swears their true love. Until the end of time another runs away separate or united? Healthy or insane? And be yourself is all that you can do (all that you can do). To be yourself is all that you can do. Be yourself is all that you can do. Even when you've paid enough been pulled apart or been held up every single memory of the good or bad, faces of love. Don't lose any sleep tonight I'm sure everything will end up alright. You may win or lose but to be yourself is all that you can do to be yourself is all that you can do.</p>
